# Junior ML Engineer – Python Debugging Assessment

## Purpose of the Assessment
This assessment evaluates Python fundamentals and debugging ability. It is not intended to test data science or machine learning theory.

For each problem:
1. Explain what the code is trying to do 
2. Identify bug in the code 
3. Provide a corrected version 
4. Run the solution with edge cases

You may solve problems in any order.
